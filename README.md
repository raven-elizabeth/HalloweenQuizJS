# JavaScript Halloween Quiz
A **JavaScript group project** with **HTML5** and **CSS** to create an interactive Halloween quiz. I **led and managed** a small team to develop this project in CodePen, which allowed us to gain collaborative coding experience.

We had a lot of fun with it. I particularly enjoyed adding audio and creating my own pixel spiders with Krita to explore my creativity further.
