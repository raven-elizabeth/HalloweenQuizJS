# JavaScript Halloween Quiz
View the webpage [here](https://raven-elizabeth.github.io/HalloweenQuizJS/).

A **JavaScript group project** with **HTML5** and **CSS** to create an interactive Halloween quiz. I **led and managed** a small team to develop this project in CodePen, which allowed us to gain collaborative coding experience.

We had a lot of fun with it. I particularly enjoyed adding audio and creating my own pixel spiders with Krita to explore my creativity further.

I have since improved it by using dictionaries (I originally repeated everything with if/else statements!) and modified the method of answering from prompts to inputs.
